# BBQ Tracker

As an avid BBQer I realized I needed a way other than google sheets or excel to track all my smoke sessions. I frequently found myself caught up in the maintenance during a session to remember to record.
This app allows the user to track their BBQ sessions and share their sessions with everyone else. Allowing anyone to get into the hobby/industry, emulate a session, and deliver delicious meat.

## MVP
- [x] save BBQ sessions
- [x] Authentication/users
- [ ] Profile to view all sessions
- [ ] Search
